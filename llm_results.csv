0,"The ownership class will continue to destroy individuals, society, and the environment if they are not stopped. Organize your workplace and neighborhood.",1,collective,"After reviewing the post, I classify it as containing both an individual call to action and a collective call to action.

The phrase ""Organize your workplace"" is an example of an individual call to action, as it targets one person or group of people to take action within their own specific context (their workplace). This type of call to action focuses on personal responsibility and change at the local level.

On the other hand, the phrase ""Organize your neighborhood"" is a collective call to action. It encourages individuals to come together with others in their community to work towards a common goal, which has broader societal implications.

My decision was influenced by the contrast between these two phrases, as well as the overall tone of the post. The language used emphasizes individual agency and collective organizing, suggesting that change is not solely dependent on one person's actions, but rather requires the involvement and cooperation of many individuals working together towards a common goal.

Rating: Both (Individual and Collective Call to Action)"," This post contains a collective call to action. The user is urging people to organize their workplaces and neighborhoods, which implies engaging with others in a group effort to bring about change. The phrase ""Organize your workplace and neighborhood"" suggests a collective, collaborative approach rather than an individual action. The underlying message seems to be that taking action collectively can help halt the destructive practices of the ownership class.",wrong,correct,,
1,"Start local! It’s nice to think about doing a general strike, but that’s like trying to run for President having never run for office. Sure, it can be done, but it’s like the hardest fucking thing to do. Start with running for city counsel or something.",1,collective,"Based on my analysis, I would classify this post as containing both an individual and a collective call to action.

The reason for this classification is that while the author is acknowledging the difficulty of organizing a large-scale action like a general strike (which could be considered a collective call to action), they are also suggesting a more incremental approach by running for local office, such as city counsel (which would be an individual call to action).

This dual approach suggests that the author recognizes the importance and feasibility of grassroots efforts at both the individual and collective levels. The post is encouraging individuals to take small steps towards activism, while also acknowledging the potential for larger-scale collective actions.

Therefore, I would label this post as containing both an individual and a collective call to action."," This post contains a collective call to action as the user is suggesting that people should start taking actions at a local level, such as running for city council, in an effort to bring about change collectively within their communities. The reasoning behind my decision is based on the language used by the user, who encourages others to act together towards a common goal (i.e., making changes in their communities). This suggestion aligns with the collective nature of the Antiwork community's discussions regarding issues related to capitalism and work.",correct,correct,Llama recognizes both and is technically not wrong as running for a local office need not involve collaborating with others even if requires them to vote.,

The language used, such as ""We are uniting"" and ""Workers are unionizing"", suggests a collective effort. The phrase ""We won't be stopped corporate"" implies that the poster is rallying others to stand together against corporate oppression.

However, the final sentence ""Suck a dick."" followed by an invitation to sign up for a protest via Google Form suggests a more individual call to action. While it's certainly possible that many people will join the protest, the tone and language of this sentence feel more like a personal insult or provocation rather than a unified rallying cry.

Overall, while there is a sense of collective unity in the post, the inclusion of the provocative sentence introduces an element of individualism that makes me categorize it as both."," This post contains a collective call to action.

3,"General protests are currently a waste of time. Remember the 1% protests that did nothing?

Best thing to do is organize labor in work places. The more people unionize their work places the better we are.",1,collective,"After reviewing this post, I would classify it as having both an individual and a collective call to action.

The language used suggests that the author has given up on general protests, implying that they believe individual actions or large-scale demonstrations won't lead to significant change. This is an individual call to action, in the sense that the author is advocating for a specific approach (organizing labor) rather than encouraging others to take part in a broader movement.

However, when the author states ""The more people unionize their work places,"" they are addressing a collective action - specifically, building and expanding labor unions. This suggests that the author believes individual actions can collectively lead to significant change."," In this post, there seems to be a call to action for individuals and collectively, but it's not explicitly stated as such. The user suggests organizing labor within workplaces (collective call to action), and implies that joining protests may not be an effective strategy at the moment (individual call to action). However, without specific instructions or resources provided, it's not as straightforward as a direct call to action.

The reasoning behind this is that the user draws a connection between past general protests and the perceived lack of impact they had, suggesting that another approach should be considered instead, which in this case is organizing labor unions. The sentiment expressed towards general protests may influence other users to question the effectiveness of such actions, potentially leading them to consider alternative means of collective action like unionization.",wrong,unsure,"For Mistral, Note that ""joining a protest"" is read as an individual action.

4,"As a practiced community organizer I tell you that many of the ""calls to action"" that are here are ill-informed and will not do a thing. sign an online petition?

Absolutely nothing will come from it if it is not followed by work stoppage, mass boycott or sabotage. Get your buddies at work to walk out before they have organized and signed union cards?

Cause we had organizing strategists in the background planning the short term and long term effective movements. Do not do anything that is an arm chair action - it will do nothing. Walking in a protest - even if you get a million people together does nothing without coordinated action that affects production and/or the rich's comfort level.",1,collective,"I would classify this post as containing both an individual call to action and a collective call to action.

The individual call to action is implicit, although not explicitly stated. The author seems to be cautioning individuals against taking certain actions (e.g., signing petitions, attending protests) that they believe will be ineffective without some form of coordinated, organized effort. This advice could be interpreted as an individual call to action to research and consider alternative approaches before taking action.

However, the text also contains several sentences that explicitly suggest collective calls to action. The author advocates for a more strategic approach, emphasizing the importance of coordination, mass boycotts, or work stoppages in achieving meaningful change. They also mention the value of organizing strategists working behind the scenes and the need for coordinated action that affects production and/or the rich's comfort level.

Specifically, the post suggests:

* Collective call to action: ""Join a protest? Absolutely nothing will come from it if it is not followed by work stoppage, mass boycott or sabotage.""
* Collective call to action: ""Get your buddies at work to walk out before they have organized and signed union cards?""
* Collective call to action: ""Making calls to congress people? Never gonna work unless you're making the lives of the people who buy them uncomfortable.""

Overall, while there is an implicit individual call to action in the post (being cautious and informed), the author's emphasis on collective, coordinated efforts makes it clear that this post contains both types of calls to action."," In this post, there is no call to action mentioned by the author directly. However, the post implies a collective call to action in its content as it encourages readers to engage in organized actions such as protests, work stoppages, mass boycotts, and sabotage for effective change.

5,This sub essentially exists to promote class struggle and general solidarity. The real working end of this is going to be unions within your company/industry and real activism outside of reddit. I'd argue this sub is an excellent way to get people exposed to ideas that are probably counter to what they've been taught by the media and at school. The success of this sub is proof that people are reaching a breaking point with business owners and that the current model is unsustainable. I'm very happy to see the rise of socialism among young people in the United States and that it's not the dirty word it used to be.,1,collective,"I would classify this post as having both an individual and collective call to action, but leaning more towards a collective call to action.

The post encourages readers to promote class struggle and solidarity, suggesting that they can take part in building a movement for change (individual call to action). However, the tone is more focused on supporting and encouraging the community's goals and values rather than providing specific instructions or directives. The author also mentions that unions within their company/industry and real activism outside of Reddit are the ""real working end"" of the subreddit's efforts, implying that individual actions should be part of a broader collective effort.

The post is more focused on promoting the subreddit's purpose and goals, rather than providing specific instructions or telling users what to do. The author does express their own personal happiness with the rise of socialism among young people in the United States, but this is more of a statement of support rather than an explicit call to action.

Therefore, while there are elements of individual call to action, I believe that the post's tone and focus are more geared towards promoting the community's values and goals, making it a collective call to action."," This post contains both an individual call to action and a collective call to action, as explained below:

1. Individual Call to Action: The user suggests that individuals should educate themselves about union organization within their company or industry, exposing them to ideas counter to what they've been taught by media and school. This can be considered an individual call to action since it is encouraging each person to take steps towards self-education and unionization.

2. Collective Call to Action: The user emphasizes the importance of general solidarity and activism outside of Reddit, which suggests organizing collectively with other workers or like-minded individuals to create real change. This can be seen as a collective call to action since it encourages people to come together and work towards a common goal (improving working conditions and promoting socialist ideologies).

In summary, the user is advocating for both individual actions (self-education and unionization) and collective efforts (solidarity and activism outside of Reddit) in their post. Their decision to focus on unions, activism, and socialist ideas within the Antiwork community reflects their commitment to promoting class struggle and encouraging members to take action towards positive change.",correct,correct,Llama reads taking part in building a movement as individual.

6,Need to organize into smaller groups by location.,1,collective,"Hello fellow antiwork community members,

I've reviewed the post in question, and I'm classifying it as: Collective Call to Action.

My reasoning is that the post seems to be sparking a discussion on organization, which is often a crucial step towards collective action against oppressive systems like capitalism. The phrase ""Need to organize into smaller groups by location"" suggests an effort to build connections between individuals in different areas who may share similar concerns or interests. This could be a precursor to larger-scale movements or actions that require coordination and cooperation.

The post doesn't appear to be urging individual users to take specific actions, but rather seems to be setting the stage for potential future collective efforts."," In this case, the post clearly suggests a Collective Call to Action. The user is advocating for people to organize into smaller groups based on their locations.

7,I'm interested in trying to help organize to have this sub facilitate people participating in May Day actions. Do you know if anyone else is organizing in that direction? Or excited to do so?,1,collective,"I would classify this post as containing a collective call to action.

My reasoning is that the author is not directly asking someone to take a specific action, but rather expressing interest in exploring the idea of facilitating May Day actions and seeking confirmation or participation from others. The language used suggests a collaborative or communal approach, with phrases such as ""organize"" and ""facilitate,"" which implies a collective effort. The author's question about whether anyone else is organizing in this direction also reinforces the idea that they are looking to join or be part of a larger movement rather than issuing an individual call to action.

The post does not contain a direct ask for someone to take a specific action, such as ""Let's organize a protest"" or ""Join me in planning a May Day event."" Instead, it invites discussion and potentially sparks interest among others who may also be interested in organizing. Therefore, I classify this post as containing a collective call to action."," Based on the post, it contains a collective call to action. The user is expressing an interest in organizing and facilitating May Day actions within the subreddit community.

I mean absolutely unionize, but it still feels like we're chasing our tails if we don't make a permanent fixture for keeping wages paying what they need to. Either this or a sizable ubi are pretty much the inevitable end game if we don't want to end up with billionaire kings.",1,collective,"After reviewing the post, I classify it as containing both an individual call to action and a collective call to action.

The individual call to action is evident in the phrase ""vote in people who will tie minimum wage to cost of living."" This implies that the author is encouraging their fellow individuals to participate in a specific process or decision-making mechanism (likely voting) to support policies that would achieve the desired outcome. The use of the word ""vote"" also suggests a direct, personal action that each individual can take.

However, the language and context also suggest a collective call to action. The author is advocating for a systemic change - tying minimum wage to cost of living - which implies that they believe it's essential to address this issue collectively through policies or societal shifts. The phrase ""unionize"" and the reference to ""billionaire kings"" also convey a sense of shared struggle and collective purpose.

The tone of the post, which acknowledges the potential difficulties but emphasizes the necessity of progress, further suggests that the author is appealing to their community's collective values and aspirations rather than simply making an individual request. Overall, while there is an explicit call to action for individuals (voting), the post also encourages a broader collective movement towards policy change and systemic reform.

Classification: Both individual and collective call to action."," This post contains both an individual and a collective call to action.

Kind of sick of paying y'alls food stamps. It's misleading to say that min wagers are paid at or above what they're 'worth' They're paid what the sleaziest among us can get away with. Collective bargaining is what allows for real price discovery on labor. Unionize everything and we won't need a minimum wage because the work that's paid less than that will actually be trivial.

If call center employees can only collectively bargain taking a call an hour from home to $5.00 an hour, that's fine because that's the number a company will break even at, not the one they can get away with due to assymetric bargaining power. It's like they don't actually want capitalism.",1,collective,"After reviewing the post, I would classify it as both a collective and individual call to action.

The individual call to action in this post is the author's personal frustration with paying food stamps (likely referring to government assistance programs) and expressing their dissatisfaction with the current system. The author seems to be using their personal experience as a way to highlight the problems with the minimum wage and the exploitation of workers.

However, the collective call to action is also present in the post, particularly in the second part where the author advocates for unionization and collective bargaining. They argue that if workers can collectively bargain for better wages, it would lead to more equitable labor practices and potentially eliminate the need for a minimum wage. This is a broader call to action, urging readers to consider the benefits of unionization and collective bargaining.

The tone and language used in the post also suggest that the author is trying to inspire discussion and action among readers, rather than simply expressing their personal feelings.

The reason for this classification is that the post contains specific actions or proposals (Amazon boycott on one day, extending it through Cyber Monday, boycotting all businesses Friday, and over the weekend) that are addressed directly to the community. These actions require individual participation from community members, which is an individual call to action.

On the other hand, the post also states ""Have a boycott of all businesses through the weekend.""

My reasoning is that while the author mentions that they will boycott certain businesses (gas station and Gamestop), they also encourage others to do so, stating ""If you want them to hurt, now is the time. Hit them the only place they can feel anything: right in their wallet.""

12,Should we cancel our streaming services to support the SAG/AFTRA strike?,1,collective,"I would classify this post as containing both an individual and a collective call to action.

The reason for this classification is that while the language of the post suggests considering a personal action (canceling one's own streaming service), it also contains elements of a larger, collective conversation about supporting the SAG/AFTRA strike. The use of ""we"" implies that the author is thinking not just about their own individual actions, but also about what others might do.

This distinction between individual and collective action is important because it reflects different aspects of social change. Individual calls to action often focus on personal behavior change, while collective calls to action seek to build a broader movement or shift in societal attitudes. In this case, the post seems to be aiming for a combination of both - encouraging individuals to take a personal action (canceling their streaming service) that also contributes to a larger, collective effort (supporting the strike)."," This post contains a Collective Call to Action. The suggestion for individuals to cancel their streaming services is a unified action that aims to support the ongoing SAG/AFTRA strike, making it a collective effort rather than an individual one.

The phrase ""the big one would be to cancel your subscriptions"" can be interpreted as an individual call to action, as it specifically suggests that the reader should take personal action by canceling their subscriptions. The suggestion is directed at the reader individually, encouraging them to make a change on their own.

On the other hand, the statement ""Bankrupt the studios before they bankrupt the writers"" is a collective call to action. It encourages a larger group of people (writers and possibly actors) to come together and take action against the studios, rather than just focusing on individual actions.

The first link provided by the OP is related to the Port of Vancouver dock workers, which is clearly a collective issue. The language used in the description suggests that the OP is seeking support for a group of people (the dock workers) who are facing bad faith actions from the government and businesses. This type of post typically elicits a collective response from the community, such as sharing information, discussing strategies, or offering solidarity.

The second link provided by the OP mentions ""First Federation"", which appears to be another subcontractor for TransLink. Since First Federation is also facing similar issues, this could be interpreted as an individual call to action aimed at supporting a specific group within the collective struggle of dock workers and other subcontracted workers.

However, considering the context of the two links provided, it's likely that the OP is primarily seeking a collective response from the community, as they are highlighting the struggles of multiple groups facing similar issues. The language ""Support these groups"" at the end of the post also suggests a collective call to action, encouraging readers to show solidarity with all affected workers.

Therefore, I would classify this post as containing both an individual and a collective call to action, but leaning more towards a collective response due to the broad scope of issues being highlighted."," This post contains both an individual and a collective call to action.

The unions can fundraise and provide money for rent and bills for striking workers. Unions can provide food for striking workers, and childcare.

A strike like this cannot be undertaken lightly. It's not a one day deal. It would need to be planned and organized, with enough resources to support the striking workers for a week or a month, or however long it takes to get action.

I put the three asks in really as a starting point for discussion. Universal single payer healthcare is a necessity. Student loan debt? Sure, but why not medical debt, too. There are a number of things that workers in this country lack which are standard in most other industrialized country.

Thanks again for your comments! Viva la revolucion!",1,collective,"Classification: Both an individual and a collective call to action

Reasoning: This post contains both personal and communal appeals for action. The author presents a set of demands (universal single payer healthcare, $24/hr minimum wage, and forgiveness of student debt) that are presented as universal asks, indicating a desire for collective change.

The language used is also inclusive, addressing the reader as ""we"" and encouraging discussion (""I put the three asks in really as a starting point for discussion""). This suggests that the author values input from others and invites participation in planning the general strike. Furthermore, the post explicitly acknowledges concerns about affordability (e.g., ""Lots of great comments - thanks!"") and suggests solutions (e.g., price caps on CEO pay), which demonstrates an awareness of individual perspectives.

However, there are also personal pleas for support (""Unions can provide food for striking workers, and childcare"") that demonstrate a sense of solidarity with the working class. The author acknowledges the challenges of organizing a strike, emphasizing the need for resources to support striking workers. These statements express empathy and understanding for individuals who might be hesitant to participate.

The overall tone is one of collective purpose, encouraging discussion and organization around shared goals. While individual perspectives are acknowledged, the post emphasizes the importance of communal action to achieve systemic change."," This post contains both an individual and a collective call to action. The individual call to action is implied as the poster suggests that each person should support the idea of a general strike, which would be an individual decision. The collective call to action is more explicit, as it outlines a proposed action (the general strike) that requires participation from a large group of people, including service workers, healthcare workers, teachers, and potentially organized labor unions.

The reasoning for this classification is based on the content of the post itself. The poster proposes a specific action (a general strike) that would require coordination among multiple groups of individuals (service workers, healthcare workers, teachers, etc.) and suggests potential solutions to common obstacles (funding for striking workers, childcare, etc.). Additionally, the post encourages readers to engage in discussion about the topic and provides a starting point for action by listing three key demands.

The language used throughout the post also emphasizes the collective nature of the proposed action, as it uses phrases like ""we would need"" and ""it's not a one day deal."" Furthermore, the poster expresses a desire for widespread support and collaboration to successfully stage the general strike. The tone is passionate and hopeful, with an emphasis on unity and solidarity among workers in the USA.

The post also reflects the values of the Antiwork community by discussing issues related to capitalism, work, and social justice. Specifically, it addresses concerns about income inequality, access to healthcare, and student debt, which are all central themes within the subreddit. The call to action aligns with the broader goals of the community, as it seeks to create systemic change that benefits workers and challenges existing power structures.",wrong,wrong,,
18,"I was just saying this to my son. I am retired but he is just entering the work force. If workers could unite and strike, even for a single day every week the big corporations couldn’t handle it. They would suffer losses much larger than if they simply raised the wages of the workers at the cost of their top 5-10%.

Edit: Thanks for the upvotes. As an old retired guy I have only opinions but no real skin in the game.

I think if this were to happen it would have to be organized with some goals in mind. What is the goal of the strike? And be exact. $24 minimum wage, 2 weeks paid leave for ALL employees, maternity/paternity leave paid, salary cap for top level execs. And with that I’m not thinking a monetary amount but more like “no employee shall make more than 20 times that of our lowest paid”. That sort of thing. That way you don’t have top echelon employees making 300 times that of the dock worker.

Also timing would have to be right. Striking on the day of the week that most hurts the bottom line, I’m thinking Monday/Tuesday. But I’m not an expert.

Also think targets. Who is it that has the power. Not “Betty Joe’s bakery”, not mom and pop stores. Franchises, corporations, big business.

It would have to be a grass roots campaign and it would take time. If everyone strikes tomorrow but there are no set goals or demands or organizational representation then it’s just a hodgepodge of people laying out of work.

The individual aspect is evident in the author's personal statement: ""I think if this were to happen it would have to be organized with some goals in mind."" This suggests that the author is sharing their own thoughts and opinions on how workers could organize a strike, but they are not taking concrete action themselves. The author also mentions that they are ""an old retired guy"" and only have ""opinions,"" indicating that they do not have personal stakes in the outcome.

However, the collective aspect is more prominent as the post progresses. The author outlines specific demands for workers, such as a $24 minimum wage, 2 weeks paid leave for all employees, maternity/paternity leave paid, salary caps for top-level executives, and limits on executive compensation relative to base pay. These demands suggest that the author believes in organizing collective action among workers, with clear goals and representation.

The phrase ""If everyone strikes tomorrow but there are no set goals or demands or organizational representation then it’s just a hodgepodge of people laying out of work"" further emphasizes the importance of collective organization and planning for any potential strike.

The collective call to action is explicitly stated in the suggestions for workers to unite, strike, and set specific goals such as a $24 minimum wage, paid leave, salary caps for top-level executives, and other demands. The reasoning behind this decision is that the poster is advocating for a coordinated effort among workers to achieve their collective goals, which involves both individual actions (joining a strike) and collective action (uniting and organizing).

My reasoning is that the post appears to be encouraging individuals to take a specific action (stopping the trucks), which could be seen as an individual call to action. However, the phrase ""if you want to put the screws to them"" suggests that the author is also appealing to a group or community of people who share their frustration with truckers and the broader capitalist system. This collective appeal implies that the post is also encouraging collective action.

The tone of the post seems to be more inflammatory and provocative, which may suggest a desire to galvanize support for a particular cause among the Antiwork community. However, without further context or information about the specific issue being referred to (e.g., truckers' labor practices, unionization efforts, etc.), it's difficult to say with certainty whether this post is primarily an individual or collective call to action.

Overall, I believe that the post contains both elements of an individual and a collective call to action."," This post contains a Collective Call to Action. The phrase ""Don't forget truckers"" is urging others in the community to consider taking action against truck drivers as a group, and the suggestion of ""stopping the trucks"" implies some form of coordinated disruption or protest against the transportation industry.

The phrase ""pool together enough food"" suggests that the poster is encouraging others to take individual action, specifically pooling their resources to help those who may be struggling financially due to striking. However, the context of a general strike and solidarity forever implies a collective aspect as well - the poster is emphasizing the importance of unity among workers who can afford to support each other during this time.

The phrase ""those of us who have the resources"" reinforces the idea that the individual actions being called upon are specifically for those with financial means, implying that others may not be in a position to contribute at this time.

22," once learned that employers will treat you how you allow them you to treat you. So the first step is actually knowing your value then knowing your boundaries, then knowing how to keep said boundaries without getting a write up.

So ask what is the expected amount of effort per amount you’re being paid?

For example. You can check websites and get an average for what your role, role adjacent pays. You can probably find first hand accounts of fhe duties or even ask your manager what their expectations are. Once you have an idea of average, you can then determine if your above or below, ans if your being compensated for it. Then adjust your work to fall within average.

So for example when I worked retail, across the board for replenishment the hourly wages was 9, later bumped to 11 to be competitive. For 9 an hour I was tasked with unloading a truck by 5 am and stocking shelves before opening at 9. i acted my wage by staying with in my assignment. No more no less. I was assigned one section. So when my managers asked me to help in other sections that was fine. I would use that work as extra hours and wasn’t beyond my scope of what I was being paid. But if they asked me to do cashiering, my answer was no. I was not being paid to do customer service. If my managers asked me on certain days to stay over my answer was no. I set the boundary that these were the days I was working no more no less. It was rough when I needed extra money, but also proved I wasn’t a dog. I did have a petty manager who tried to get me to quit. Those are the ones you really have to watch out for, but boundaries generally work for most rational people.",0,individual,"Based on this post, I would classify it as containing both an individual and a collective call to action.

The individual call to action is present in the author's personal anecdote about how they set boundaries with their manager and successfully negotiated fair compensation for their workload. This serves as a personal example of how individuals can take control of their own work environment and communicate their needs effectively.

The collective call to action, however, is hinted at by the suggestion that ""boundaries generally work for most rational people."" This implies that there may be others who have had similar experiences with managers or employers who are not as reasonable, and encourages readers to be mindful of such individuals. The author also mentions having to ""watch out"" for petty managers, which could be interpreted as a call to action for readers to be vigilant and protect themselves from exploitation.

The phrase ""Don't do more"" suggests an individual call to action for individuals to be mindful of their workload and not take on excessive tasks. It encourages personal responsibility and self-regulation.

On the other hand, the overall tone and message of the post can also be seen as a collective call to action. The phrase ""Never go beyond the scope of your specific job"" implies that this is a universal expectation or ideal that should apply to all individuals in a similar situation. It suggests that there is a broader cultural or societal expectation for workers to fulfill their roles without overstepping or taking on unnecessary tasks.

The final two sentences, ""'I'm just doing my job.' 'I'm just doing what I'm told,'"" can be seen as a collective call to action, urging people to recognize and challenge the status quo of blindly following orders and accepting excessive workload. It encourages individuals to think critically about their work and question the motivations behind their tasks.

My reasoning is that while the post does encourage individual behavior (i.e., doing extra work without sharing it), it's more focused on creating and maintaining a certain narrative or social contract within the workplace rather than directly prompting individuals to take specific actions. The post seems to be promoting a strategy for coping with an expected workload, rather than explicitly telling people what action to take.

The tone of the post is somewhat sarcastic and tongue-in-cheek, suggesting that this is not a straightforward call to action but rather a suggestion for how to navigate a system that values productivity over honesty. Overall, I see this as more of a commentary on the nature of work and capitalism than a direct call to action.

That being said, if someone were to take this post as a personal challenge or use it as inspiration to start reevaluating their own workflow, then it could be argued that there is an individual component to the call to action. However, in its current form, I believe the post is more focused on highlighting systemic issues rather than directly encouraging individuals to take specific actions.

Therefore, my classification is Collective Call to Action with a possible Individual Component."," This post contains no call to action.

My reasoning is based on the tone and language used in the post. The author seems to be advocating for a general mindset or approach towards work, rather than targeting specific individuals or actions. The focus is on challenging societal expectations around work and productivity, rather than making a direct demand or request to take a particular action.

The phrase ""don't fix it"" and ""don't optimize it"" could be interpreted as individual actions, but the context suggests that these are broader principles for how to approach one's job. The author is essentially saying that workers should adopt this mindset in their daily work, rather than making an explicit call to take a specific action.

While the post does encourage individuals to adopt a certain behavior or attitude towards their work, it does so as part of a larger critique of capitalism and societal expectations around productivity.

Reasoning: I classified this post as an individual call to action because it encourages the reader to take a specific action towards improving their own working conditions, which is focused on a personal level rather than making broader changes in the workplace or advocating for collective change.

The post does not mention any large-scale actions that would typically be considered a collective call to action. Instead, it suggests having open and honest discussions with colleagues about wages, compensation, benefits, and work conditions, which can be done individually within a team or department before potentially escalating to more formal requests for changes at the management level.

That being said, encouraging an individual to engage in open discussions with their colleagues is still a crucial step towards collective action. Therefore, while the post primarily advocates for individual behavior change, it lays groundwork for potential group-level impact."," This post contains a collective call to action. The discussion encourages individuals to take collective action by discussing wages, compensation, benefits, and work conditions with their colleagues, which is aimed at creating positive changes within their workplace as a group.

The individual call to action is clear in the phrase ""During non-working time"" because it targets each individual user, encouraging them to disconnect from their work-related communications during personal time. The specific instruction to not respond to emails, texts, calls, or other communication implies that this is a personal choice for each user.

However, the post also implies a collective call to action by framing this as a necessity within the capitalist system. By stating ""during non-working time,"" it assumes that users are subject to work-related expectations and obligations outside of their formal working hours. This phrase suggests that users need to take action (or inaction) collectively to opt-out of these pressures.

Furthermore, the post is situated within the broader context of discussions about work, capitalism, and labor rights on r/Antiwork, which often emphasize collective resistance against oppressive systems. The tone of the post seems to encourage users to make a personal choice that aligns with anti-capitalist values, while also acknowledging the need for collective action.

Overall, I would conclude that this post contains both an individual call to action and a collective call to action, as it targets each user's personal choices but also situates them within a broader discussion of systemic change."," The post you provided suggests a personal action, specifically abstaining from work-related communication during non-working hours. Therefore, this post contains an individual call to action.

40,No one should ever work off the clock. Why would anyone do that?,0,individual,"After reviewing the post, I classify it as containing neither an individual nor a collective call to action.

My reasoning is that while the statement ""No one should ever work off the clock"" expresses a personal opinion or feeling about the issue of working off the clock, it does not provide any specific instructions, suggestions, or recommendations for individuals or the community to take concrete actions. The post appears to be more of an expression of frustration or exasperation with the idea of working off the clock, rather than a call to action.

The tone of the post is also quite emotive and opinion-based, without any explicit encouragement or invitation to join a cause, participate in a movement, or engage in specific actions. Therefore, I have categorized it as not containing an individual or collective call to action."," In this specific post, I would classify it as containing a Collective Call to Action. The post emphasizes a shared understanding among Antiwork community members about the unacceptability of working off the clock.

41,"Take your breaks, don't work for free.",0,individual,"I would classify this post as containing both an individual and a collective call to action.

The phrase ""Take your breaks"" is an individual call to action, encouraging the reader to prioritize their own well-being and take time off when needed.

However, the additional part of the sentence ""don't work for free"" has a broader impact. It's not just telling one person to stop working without pay, but rather a statement that can be applied to the entire system and culture surrounding capitalism. This phrase suggests that the value of labor is not always recognized or fairly compensated, which is a systemic issue.

Therefore, while the post initially seems like an individual call to action, it actually has a collective aspect to it, as it's addressing a common problem with the capitalist system and encouraging readers to think critically about their own experiences and the broader implications."," In this post, I would classify it as an Individual Call to Action. The user is suggesting that people should take their breaks and not work for free, which implies a direct action that each person can take in their own lives to manage their work-life balance and respect their time.

42,Don’t ever poop before you clock in. Poop on company time.,0,individual,"Classification: No call to action.

My reasoning is that the post is primarily presenting an anecdote about the author's personal behavior (pooping before clocking in) and making a humorous, sarcastic comment about it being acceptable to do so on company time. There is no explicit encouragement or suggestion for others to follow suit, nor is there any appeal for like-minded individuals to adopt this behavior as a collective action against capitalist norms.

That being said, the post does contain a form of critique of corporate culture and the notion that one should be punished for using their allotted work time as intended (i.e., relieving themselves). However, it's presented in a tongue-in-cheek manner and doesn't explicitly encourage others to take similar action or adopt this behavior as a way to resist or subvert the capitalist system."," This post contains a Collective Call to Action.

43,Is it time to boycott companies who are forcing RTO?,1,collective,"After reviewing the post, I would classify it as containing a Collective Call to Action.

My reasoning is that the post asks if it's ""time"" for a group of people (implied by the collective use of ""is it"") to take action against certain companies. The word ""boycott"" also suggests a mass movement or widespread effort, rather than an individual decision. Additionally, the tone of the post seems to be inquiring about the wisdom and timing of a potential collective action, which implies that the author is seeking input from others on whether it's a good idea. Overall, the language used suggests a call to action that would likely involve many people working together, rather than an individual action.

In contrast, if the post simply stated ""I'm considering boycotting companies that force RTO"" or ""Let's boycott companies that are forcing RTO"", I might classify it as an Individual Call to Action."," This post contains a Collective Call to Action.

My reasoning is that the author explicitly states ""we put 2 and 2 together"" implying a shared understanding or consensus among the undocumented immigrants at work about their situation. The phrase ""they're gonna use my SSN and whoever else they got their mitts on to cover for my housekeepers"" suggests that the author believes other employees, including undocumented immigrants, are also aware of this potential exploitation. This collective awareness and shared concern influence the author's decision to speak out against the hotel owner's actions.

While the author does express a personal desire to leave the job due to exploitation, the text focuses more on the potential consequences of the hotel owner's actions and the need for action to protect other employees. The tone is informative and alarmist rather than directly asking the reader to take specific actions, which is why I classify this post as a collective call to action.

TL;DR: I got a 26% raise by accident, HR confirmed no further action needed, predicted by the green candle of health and abundance.

Cause and effect might not match entirely, but my wife's mother has this tradition every end of year about gifting wrapped candles to family, depending on the color you get it's your karma for the year.

Some candles are ""bad"", for like, personal development and challenges, some are good, like the green candle, which symbolizes health and abundance.

I'm not superstitious but last year the candle was purple: changes. And yeah, I moved cities which was hard but I'm alright now.

Anyways, it's a funny segway to what happened last week at my job.

They notified we were all getting a 5% raise due to local inflation rates. It's the customary thing in the company. Which really does not represent much, the national increment in my country for the minimum wage was 12% for comparison, though I don't make minimum wage.

I've actually been dissatisfied with my job lately. Things are slow and management is focused on other things. I feel a bit trapped, stagnant.

It's not a bad job or company, it's just something about me maybe.

But let's continue. I saw my week 1 payment stub, and I was perplexed by it. The percentage in base pay difference was not 5%, it was higher than 20%, 26 to be exact.

For raises you sign a sheet and, I'd think any company would make a big fuss about it. But I just got that out of nowhere.

I figured it was a mistake, and I still believe it was. I debated about telling HR, maybe I could just keep quiet about it. But after consulting with my partner and thinking clearly, I knew it was best for me to bring it up to avoid issues.

So I notified the payments lady and the HR manager. They were both puzzled by what I showed them.

That same week they were having issues with corporate because apparently everyone had issues with their paystubs, missed overtime, bonuses or just issues in general. Probably a new guy at accounting is messing things up.

They told me they would check and come back to me. I was feeling weird about the whole situation because it's weird to know you are not valued as an employee enough to deserve a raise without asking for it, I know, fairytales.

HR came back to me and told me accounting told them it was correct and to leave it at that, despite them checking it was not a 5% difference.

So, I was honest about it and for some reason I still don't understand, I got a raise, by accident? I bet it was accounting's mistake but they didn't want to admit it, plus it's already registered with the government and in my country it is illegal to lower payment without the employee's consent.

The difference is almost an entire minimum wage in my country, and it will allow me to save some money for once.

Basically, a massive hospital system bought out almost every local specialty clinic in the area over the last ten years. Lots of providers didn't like this because their rules are whack, and they left the area. This created a massive provider shortage. So we have people who are waiting to see specialists just dying because they can't get in on time. I'm talking dying in the ED of strokes or heart attacks because they couldn't get the vascular surgery they desperately needed. And since the hospital system owns the majority of the primary care offices too, they won't refer to the nearest big city, which is only like 2 hours away.

Enter my clinic, owned by providers who left that hospital system. They had a deal where we were going to be an in between point for those patients while waiting to see their specialists (the primary cares are booked out months too). We were going to do things like labs, EKGs, and X-rays to make sure the patients were stable while waiting, and if not, send them to the ED, which was conveniently located across the street. Basically an urgent care specifically for people with chronic illnesses to keep them alive long enough to actually SEE their specialists. Seems like a good idea for everyone, right?

So about a week before opening, the hospital board calls an emergency meeting. They tell us that they've changed their minds, they don't want to share patients with us because they'd lose money. Our provider reminds them that we would technically be urgent care, so we wouldn't be keeping any patients as primary care patients. The board doesn't care, because even seeing us once takes money from them. They won't be referring any patients to us. We remind them that the patients are already waiting up to a year in some cases to see specialists, and months to see their primary cares. Yes, but if they give money to us, they're not giving money to them. And that's a problem. People will continue to die. Well, that's just the cost of doing business.

Your death is just the cost of doing business for the CEOs and directors of these healthcare facilities. My dad died last year in that shitty hospital, while being helped by nurses and doctors who work for a CEO who makes millions of dollars while they literally have to go on strike to get maternity leave or overtime pay. Imagine you can't get the day off to take your dog to the vet, or watch your kids soccer game, or because you've got the flu because your hospital isn't staffed right, while the CEO owns a fucking super yacht.

The author explicitly states that they are ""sick of this absolute game show of a country"" and laments the fact that CEOs and directors make millions while nurses and doctors struggle to get basic benefits like maternity leave or overtime pay.

This suggests that the author is calling on individuals to recognize the inhumane practices of the healthcare system and to support workers' rights, such as fair compensation and benefits. However, this call to action is somewhat implicit and aimed at raising awareness rather than taking a specific action.

The collective call to action, on the other hand, can be seen in the author's frustration with the hospital board's decision not to share patients with their clinic. The author explicitly states that people will ""continue to die"" if the hospital doesn't prioritize patient care over profits.

The individual call to action is directed towards the author's employer, specifically their line manager and upper management, in response to their demands to work all four weekends from now on. The author explicitly states that they have tried to explain their childcare needs and has put in for flexible working, but received a non-committal response. This suggests that the individual call to action is focused on advocating for the author's own rights and interests.

However, upon closer reading, it becomes clear that this post also contains elements of a collective call to action. The author explicitly states their frustration with the company's policies, stating ""Just so sick of the idea that as workers we are not allowed any other commitments or to live our lives."" This phrase suggests that the author is aware of and sympathetic to the experiences of other workers who may be facing similar challenges. Furthermore, the tone of the post implies a broader critique of capitalist systems and the treatment of workers, which is a common theme in the Antiwork subreddit.

My reasoning is that while the author shares their personal experience of suffering from the negative effects of capitalism (non-stop stress, long work weeks, lack of support), they also make it clear that this experience was not unique. They mention that the owners ""destroyed my life"" and laid off 1/3 of the staff, implying that this is a common consequence of capitalist practices in small businesses.

This phrase, ""they didn't 'read' the economy,"" suggests a broader critique of the system and the actions of those in power, rather than just a personal complaint. The author is not asking the reader to take action to improve their own situation, but rather to recognize and understand the systemic issues that led to their experience.

Therefore, while there may be some individual resonance with the author's story, I believe that the overall tone of the post is more aligned with encouraging readers to think critically about the broader impacts of capitalism."," This post contains no call to action.

The tone is personal, and the author seems to be speaking directly to these individuals, saying ""We're enabling a bunch of grown toddlers"" and stating that they should be held accountable for their actions.

However, the post also takes on a more universal tone, urging readers to recognize the need for discussion and equality among all people. The author writes, ""It's literally just talking. Why should we have to fight to expect to have a discussion with our fellows, our equals?"" This phrase suggests that the issue is not just about one group of individuals, but rather about creating a broader cultural shift towards valuing communication, equality, and mutual respect.

The final sentence, ""We're in this together. Where are the grown ups???"", further reinforces the collective call to action, encouraging readers to come together and demand better from themselves and others.

The tone is critical and instructive, encouraging readers to think critically about the messages they receive.

The collective call to action, however, is explicit in the following phrases:

* ""We constantly see rich people at parties together"" - This phrase suggests that the author wants their fellow users to pay attention to the social connections between the wealthy and recognize how these networks perpetuate inequality.
* ""They are elitist and thoroughly believe that...""; this indicates a need for awareness about classism and elitism among all users, including those in positions of power.

* Individual Call to Action: The author explicitly states their personal experience with being forced to come in to work despite hazardous conditions (""I lost control trying to cross the same bridge...""), and they express their frustration and dissatisfaction with their current boss. This is an individual call to action, where the author is calling on themselves to speak up against the unfair demands of their employer.
* Collective Call to Action: The post also contains hints at a broader issue that affects many workers in similar situations. The mention of the ""head of the company"" sending out an email, and the contrast with the author's old boss who seemed more concerned about employee well-being (""My old boss who saw people as humans instead of a series of KPIs""), suggests that this is not just a personal issue, but also a systemic problem that affects many workers. The tone of the post implies that the author wants to spark a conversation or mobilize others who have similar experiences, making it a collective call to action.

The phrase ""I miss my old boss"" also carries an undertone of solidarity with other workers who may feel similarly undervalued and mistreated by their employers.

Additionally, the fact that the author is 72 and retired already stopped working eliminates any potential scope for mobilization or collective action among retired individuals.

However, the post also contains a collective call to action. The author is essentially challenging or encouraging others in similar positions (i.e., employees of other financial institutions) to stand up against what they perceive as unnecessary changes.

The individual call to action in this post is implicit, although not explicitly stated. The author identifies themselves as an ex-freight riding homeless person, which shares their personal experience with others who may be facing similar struggles. This establishes a connection between the reader and the author's perspective, potentially encouraging readers to reflect on their own experiences.

A collective call to action is present as well.

This recommendation invites the reader to explore these ideas further.

The mention of propaganda of the deed also carries a collective connotation since it is often associated with actions taken collectively by groups or individuals in solidarity with social justice movements. 

Overall, while there isn't an explicit call to action towards individual readers in this post, there are indications that encourage readers to participate actively within their own communities and explore ideas through personal reading, thereby fostering a collective mindset among like-minded individuals"," This post contains both an individual call to action and a collective call to action.

The individual call to action is implicit in the recommendation for people to read specific authors such as Malatesta, Goldman, Klee Benally, Kropotkin.

The collective call to action is also present, although less explicit than the individual one. The statement ""As a ex freight riding homeless person, I back this"" indicates that the poster supports the broader movement of questioning capitalism and work structures. Furthermore, the reference to ""an infantile movement"" not bringing any more than ""the propaganda of the deed (I.E. Luigi)"" implies that the poster believes in taking collective action, as exemplified by figures like Luigi who engaged in direct action against capitalism and its oppressive systems.

68,"A couple of months ago I posted about how I got fired due to having a miscarriage, you can click on the username to see it. I thought I would give an update because it's awesome.

First, I'll update about me. I ended up going back to the company I left in May. I was able to negotiate a $20,000 raise from when I left, some extra pto, and my job is remote and based out of a city several hours away, so I don't interact with any of the people who were the reason I left in the first place and wouldn't met me change positions. With the pay raise I was able to get the best health insurance offered which is great because I need surgery for my endometriosis. I cautiously say life is pretty good, and this is the most stable I have ever been in my 35 years of life. My partner will finish up his masters degree next year, and we plan to leave our shitty state with no opportunities.

Ok, now to the company. This shit is so good. So a bunch of people were let go from the company and we all have banded together. We were unable to find an attorney willing to take the case because they did not think the owner would be able to pay the settlement or had enough assets. That was a bummer, but I got justice anyway.

Shit went down the week of Christmas. Owner went on a cruise that she complained openly was super expensive. She was also leaving notes and saying things around the office that her nanny had a crush on her (which was weird because she has a husband).

So the week of Christmas she was gone and literally everyone's check bounced. There was no money in the business account. It also came out that she kicked her husband out of the suite and he stayed where the nanny was going to be instead. Then the kids started telling him that their mom (the owner of where I got fired) was sleeping naked with the nanny, kissing each other and showering together, etc.

It gets better. While she was gone, she was reported for medicaid fraud and is under investigation. She was billing a bunch of people under the same provider number long story short. She also got reported for being unethical since the nanny was receiving counseling at her office and living with her and paid by her. If you don't know social work ethics, just trust me it is a big deal and she may lose her license to practice. Almost everyone has quit the company.

This is poetic justice. Karma is a bitch.",,neither,"I would classify this post as containing both an individual and a collective call to action.

The individual call to action is implicit in the author's personal experience. The author shares their own situation, where they got fired due to having a miscarriage, but were able to negotiate a better deal with the company and are now more stable financially. This suggests that the author encourages others who may be going through similar experiences to seek justice and advocate for themselves.

The collective call to action is evident in the way the author describes the situation at their former workplace as ""poetic justice"" and states that ""almost everyone has quit the company."" The author seems to be encouraging others who may have been wronged by their employer, such as those who were let go without pay or were mistreated, to join together and advocate for change. This collective action is implied by the fact that a group of former employees banded together to seek justice, but were unable to find an attorney willing to take on their case due to lack of assets.

The author's tone also suggests that they are encouraging others to speak out against injustice and to support one another in their struggles. The phrase ""Karma is a bitch"" implies a sense of solidarity with those who have been wronged, and encourages readers to seek revenge or justice in the form of collective action.

Overall, while the post does not explicitly state a call to action, the author's personal experience and description of the situation at their former workplace suggest that they are encouraging others to take action and advocate for themselves and others."," This post contains both an individual call to action (the user going back to the same company they left previously, negotiating better terms, and undergoing surgery for their health) and a collective call to action (the group of people who were fired banding together and eventually causing the downfall of the owner due to her unethical behavior).

My reasoning is that while the post does express concern about the individual author's ability to resist the system (""unless we can pull together""), it does not contain a clear, specific request for individuals to take action. The author is more focused on describing the historical context and warning about the consequences of technological advancements than making a demand for collective change.

However, the post as a whole implies that collective action is necessary to prevent a return to the old feudal system, which suggests that the community may consider organizing or discussing ways to resist or challenge the status quo. Therefore, while it's not a direct call to action, I would classify it as containing a collective call to action due to its emphasis on the need for collective resistance and its implications for community discussion and potential action."," This post does not contain a call to action.

The reason for this decision is that the user presents an opinion about historical and social structures, but does not propose any specific action or course of action for individuals or the community to take. The mention of concerns about technology and the future suggests that the user might be implying a need for unity (collective call to action), but without providing clear guidance on what actions should be taken, it is difficult to classify this as such.

Advice include praising inefficient coworkers, cry and sob frequently at work, asking inane questions in meetings, and spreading gossip.",,individual,"After reviewing the post, I would classify it as containing both an individual call to action and a collective call to action.

The individual call to action is present because the advice provided (e.g., praising inefficient coworkers, cry and sob frequently at work) seems to be tailored towards sabotaging one's own workplace or organization. This suggests that the reader is encouraged to engage in this behavior personally, potentially as an act of resistance against their employer or capitalist system.

On the other hand, the collective call to action is also present because the post references a historical document (the ""Simple Sabotage Field Manual"") and its declassification in 2008. This implies that antiwork sentiment and actions are not new, but rather part of a larger cultural and intellectual history that can be built upon by others. The fact that the manual was declassified also suggests that there may be a community or group of people who have been working on similar ideas or actions over time.

However, I do not see an explicit call to action for the reader to take a specific course of action or join a movement at this moment. Instead, the post seems more focused on sharing information and providing examples from history, which can be used as inspiration or motivation for individual actions or collective organizing efforts in the future."," This post does not contain a call to action, either individual or collective.

We build community relay on one another and become stronger together!",,collective,"Based on my analysis, I would classify this post as containing a collective call to action. Here's why:

* While the post does express frustration with being ""hit where it hurts"" by consumerism, it's framed in a way that encourages a unified community effort rather than individual actions.
* The use of phrases like ""we need to unify"" and ""as the working class,"" suggests that the author is speaking to a collective group rather than targeting individuals directly.
* The post advocates for a coordinated action (stopping work and consumerism) that benefits everyone, rather than focusing on personal gains or individual victories.
* While there's an implicit call to action, it's more of a rallying cry to unite the community in a shared goal, rather than a direct directive to take specific actions.

That being said, if I were to nitpick, I might consider this post as containing both a collective and an individual aspect. The collective call to action is strong, but the use of phrases like ""STOP GOING TO WORK"" does have an individualistic tone, emphasizing personal responsibility over societal change. However, given the overall emphasis on community building and unity, I lean towards classifying it as a collective call to action."," This post contains both an individual call to action and a collective call to action. The individual call to action is implied in the phrase ""Stop working"" which suggests each person should stop participating in work, while the collective call to action is more explicitly stated when the user encourages all members of the working class to organize a specific date to stop going to work collectively. This post influences the decision due to its explicit instruction for individuals to take action (stop working) and for a group of people (the working class) to coordinate their actions (stop working on a specific date).

72,"The best time to start mutial aid, community building, and organization was years ago.. the second best time is today.

So start building mutial aid. Community and start organizing now!",,collective,"Classification: Collective Call to Action

My reasoning for this classification is that while there are individual actions being encouraged (""start building mutual aid"", ""start organizing""), the overall tone and message of the post emphasize the importance of collective action in the present moment (""the best time to start... was years ago.. the second best time is today""). The post also uses a rhetorical question, implying that the reader is part of the collective and should take immediate action.

While there are individual actions being called upon, the emphasis on ""mutual aid"", ""community building"", and ""organization"" as a whole suggests that the author is urging readers to work together towards a common goal. Therefore, I classify this post as a Collective Call to Action, rather than simply an individual call to action.

It's worth noting that the tone of the post is also somewhat motivational and inspirational, which can sometimes be indicative of a Collective Call to Action. However, the specific language used and the emphasis on collective action in the present moment led me to classify it as such."," This post contains a collective call to action. The user is urging the community to start mutual aid, build communities, and organize collectively, which indicates a group effort rather than an individual one.

* The language used is strong and militant (""We need a general strike!"", ""It's time we fight back!""), which suggests a shared sentiment among the community.

* While there may be some variation in specific ideologies (e.g., ""preferably without any kind of central State""), this does not seem to be a matter of personal opinion being expressed. Rather, it seems like a general stance shared by the community.
* The focus on ""the Working Class vs the Ruling Class"" suggests a shared identity and a call to action that transcends individual differences in politics or ideology.

The author also provides additional suggestions (forming your own union, getting elected, etc.) that are targeted at individuals who may be hesitant or dissatisfied with existing unions.

However, the post quickly shifts its tone and expands the scope of the suggestion, encouraging readers to think about ""what you can do today"" and emphasizing the importance of collective action (""work within the system"", form a bigger lobbying organization). This suggests that the author is also advocating for broader changes in society, rather than just individual actions.

The post includes personal details about the author's financial struggles, housing situation, and health issues, which is a clear expression of their individual experience with poverty and disability. This could be seen as an individual call to action in the sense that it humanizes the issue and invites readers to empathize or share similar experiences.

However, upon closer examination, I don't see any explicit requests for collective action, protests, or discussions on policy changes. The post is more of a personal account, sharing the author's struggles and feelings about their situation. While it may inspire empathy or spark conversations in the comments, there isn't an overt call to action that encourages users to take a specific course of action or engage in collective organizing.

That being said, the post could still be seen as sparking a discussion about systemic issues, such as inadequate disability support, poverty rates, and government policies affecting low-income individuals. This aspect of the post leans more towards a collective conversation, but it's not a direct call to action that requires immediate response or participation from users.

The language used in the post, ""fear not your red brothers and sisters"", could be interpreted as a call to individuals to feel less isolated or judged about their economic status. This part of the post is more likely to inspire an individual call to action, encouraging people to reframe their perceptions about poverty and classism.

However, the phrase ""the next war coming is the class war"" has a broader implication, suggesting that the collective struggle against classism is not just a personal issue but a systemic one. This statement invites individuals to consider themselves part of a larger community, where economic struggles are shared and collectively addressed. It's an appeal to join or participate in this collective effort.

Overall, I believe both aspects are present in the post, aiming to inspire individual reflection and collective solidarity against class-based oppression."," This post contains a collective call to action.

The customer started asking me why I needed an ID to pay a bill and became visibly upset and rude. I explained it is for security and how our system works.

However, as the post progresses, the tone shifts from focusing on the individual's personal experience to making broader statements about the company's policies and the impact of corporate decisions.

The individual call to action comes from the author's statement: ""This sounds bad but I wish they would let me go too."" This is a personal plea for autonomy and relief from the oppressive conditions imposed by the private equity company. The author is explicitly expressing their desire for release from their job, which is a clear call to action.

On the other hand, the collective call to action can be inferred from the author's description of the situation: ""the private equity company who acquired my company is ruining our business.""

The post starts by sharing a personal experience of taking sick days for mental health reasons, which is an individual call to action. The author is sharing their own strategy for managing stress and prioritizing self-care in a way that resonates with the community.

However, when the author advises ""Never fake symptoms, and there will never be any questions or concerns about if you're faking it,"" they are making a broader statement that encourages readers to take responsibility for their mental health and not fake sickness. This phrase is a call to action for individuals within the community to prioritize authenticity and honesty in discussing their needs.

Additionally, by stating ""All you need to say is 'I really don't feel well today, not sure what's going on, I'm going to take the day off and rest, and try and make it back in for tomorrow/Monday',"" the author is essentially creating a model or example for how individuals can communicate their needs with their employers. This could be seen as a collective call to action, encouraging community members to normalize taking mental health days and advocate for similar policies within their workplaces.

Overall, while the post primarily shares a personal experience, it also contains implicit advice and encouragement that extend beyond individual circumstances to become a broader call to action for the community."," This post contains an individual call to action. The user is encouraging others to take mental health days off from work when needed by using specific language like ""I call in for a mental health day"" and suggesting how to phrase the request to their employer (""I really don't feel well today, not sure what's going on, I'm going to take the day off and rest"").

My reasoning is that while the post shares an interesting anecdote about the benefits of having generous sick leave policies in Poland, it does not explicitly encourage or invite users to take any specific actions. The content is observational and informative, aiming to raise awareness about a particular aspect of Polish healthcare. There's no direct ask or suggestion for readers to contact their own doctors, organize protests, share their own experiences, or engage in any other form of collective action."," This post does not contain a call to action.

The post provides personal advice (""I like to make the decision the night before..."") which suggests that the author has found a strategy for approaching phone calls, including pretending to be ill with a ""just woke up"" voice. This part of the post is individual in nature, as it's the author sharing their own technique.

However, when mentioning ""family members"" as an excuse to be avoided, I see this as a collective call to action. The phrase suggests that others should also avoid using family members as excuses when making phone calls, implying a shared understanding or expectation among those who are likely familiar with these tactics. This collective aspect is implied through the use of the plural noun ""family members"", which suggests that there may be others who have encountered similar situations and would benefit from avoiding this particular approach.

Overall, while the post does contain individual advice, it also carries a subtle implication for collective behavior in terms of avoiding certain phone call tactics."," This post contains no call to action. The user is sharing a strategy for dealing with difficult phone calls or conversations, but they are not asking others to join them in implementing this strategy or take any specific action.

86,"First off, always take your law mandated breaks. Second, if they are messaging you on a personal phone, block the number.",,individual,"Classification: No Call to Action

Reasoning: The post appears to be sharing two general tips or pieces of advice related to dealing with workplace harassment or unwanted contact from colleagues or supervisors. There is no explicit request for individuals to take specific actions, such as protesting a company's policies, participating in a strike, or organizing a group response.

The language used is more casual and advisory, suggesting that the author is sharing personal anecdotes or experiences rather than making a direct appeal to the community to take collective action. Therefore, I have classified this post as having no call to action."," This post contains both an individual call to action and a collective call to action.

The first sentence (""Always take your law mandated breaks."") is an individual call to action as it encourages each user to prioritize self-care by taking their legally required breaks at work.

The second sentence (""If they are messaging you on a personal phone, block the number."") can be seen as a collective call to action because it suggests that multiple users may be experiencing harassment from their employers or colleagues outside of work hours, and the suggested solution (blocking the number) could potentially help many people in similar situations.

In summary, the post encourages individuals to prioritize self-care by taking breaks when required, while also offering a potential collective solution for dealing with workplace harassment.",wrong,wrong,,
87,Take those damn vacation days and see the world now!!,,individual,"I've reviewed the post and would classify it as having a collective call to action.

My reasoning is that while the post does encourage individual action (taking one's vacation days), the overall tone suggests that this is a suggestion aimed at individuals in general, rather than a specific personal call to action. The use of ""damn"" and the emotive language (""see the world now"") conveys a sense of frustration with the current system, which implies that the author is speaking to others who may be experiencing similar feelings.

Additionally, the post's tone seems more like a rallying cry or a statement of solidarity rather than a personal plea. It's as if the author is encouraging others to take control of their own time and freedom, rather than making a specific request to someone else.

Overall, while there is an individual call to action implied in ""take those damn vacation days"", I believe that the post is more focused on inspiring collective action and challenging the status quo."," This post contains an individual call to action as it encourages the readers to take their own vacation days. However, the sentiment behind this call to action could be seen as a broader critique of overworking under capitalism, which might inspire others to also take time off work (a collective action).

88,Grab a clipboard and a pen and go for a walk. Everyone will assume you already have a task. Which you do: avoiding more work.,,individual,"Based on the post, I would classify it as both an individual and a collective call to action.

The language used in the post is quite playful and suggests that the author is using humor to subvert societal expectations around work. The phrase ""Grab a clipboard and a pen"" is often associated with task lists or work assignments, but here, it's being used to highlight how people may already be perceived as busy even when they're taking time off.

The post encourages individuals to take a walk without feeling the need to justify their actions, suggesting that people might feel pressured to always be ""on the clock"" and be seen as productive. This is an individual call to action, as it's targeting the personal mindset and behavior of the reader.

At the same time, the post also has a broader relevance to collective societal norms around work and productivity. By pointing out how society often assumes people are already working, the post is highlighting a larger issue that affects many individuals. This makes the call to action more than just individualized; it's also about challenging these societal expectations and creating space for relaxation and leisure.

Overall, I believe this post contains both an individual call to action (to be mindful of how you present yourself as always being productive) and a collective call to action (to challenge the societal norms around work and productivity)."," This post contains an individual call to action, as it suggests the user ""Grab a clipboard and a pen and go for a walk."" However, the collective aspect is implied in the phrase ""Everyone will assume you already have a task,"" which suggests a larger group may also be engaging in similar actions.

You need something from my group that was going to take two weeks? And you knew about this a month ago? And you need this in two days? It's gonna be two weeks, fam.",,individual,"I would classify this post as containing both an individual and a collective call to action.

The first sentence ""You need something from my group that was going to take two weeks?"" can be interpreted as a request for assistance, which is an individual call to action. The user is directly asking someone within their group to provide a service or resource.

However, the phrase ""And you knew about this a month ago? And you need this in two days?"" has a tone of incredulity and frustration, implying that the requestor feels taken advantage of by the person they are addressing. This sentiment is more characteristic of collective action, as it highlights the perceived unfairness or exploitation.

The final sentence ""It's gonna be two weeks, fam"" can also be seen as an example of collective action, as it uses a casual and informal tone to express solidarity with others who may have faced similar situations. The use of the phrase ""fam"" suggests that the user is part of a community or group, which reinforces the idea that this post contains both individual and collective calls to action.

Overall, while there is an individual request for assistance, the tone and language used in the post suggest that the user is also trying to rally support from others within their group."," This post contains no call to action.

My reasoning is that while the post encourages individuals to take a ""bare minimum"" approach in their jobs, where they only follow the contract's letter but not its spirit, it also suggests a broader societal strategy. The phrase ""they'll figure it out after the 3rd no call/no show"" implies a collective approach, as if many people following this advice would collectively exert enough pressure on the system to make change happen.

The individual call to action is the personal decision to take a minimalist approach in one's job. However, the collective aspect of the post suggests that if many individuals adopt this strategy, it could lead to systemic changes and potentially even broader social movements.

So, while the post primarily advocates for an individual-level strategy, it also contains elements of a collective call to action, particularly in its reference to the potential cumulative effect on the system."," This post contains no call to action. The user is providing advice on how to behave at work, which does not inherently encourage others to take any specific action. It does suggest leaving one's job when finding a new one, but this is presented as a personal decision and not a collective call to action. The absence of explicit language encouraging others to follow the same path contributes to my determination that there is no call to action in this post.",wrong,wrong,,

When has an employer ever been honest to you in any job description, interview, or work interaction? For me, personally, it has been never. There is always atleast some level of bullshit to make them job seem easier, better, require more skills or education, require more/less hours than actually necessary or and endless number of other things. Not to mention the times where they disrespect you straight to your face. I have no qualms about lying on your resume, especially about something as trivial as this. If you think you can do the job and you want it, then I say try your best to fake it till you make it and if you end up getting caught, try something else... or just lie more next time lol. Seems like the guy above me has good, honest intentions, but he's been in the system so long he's brainwashed into being oblivious of the fact that all the guys on the top who are hiring him lied on their resumes too. In fact, 79% of Americans in management positions admit to having lied, omitted, or exaggerated at least one part of their resume.

My whole resume was tailor-made to the job I wanted, falsifying one degrees and 6 years of experience, and guess where that got me? In the position I wanted making far more than I would be otherwise and significantly happier. However, it wasn't a position that would look too extensively into my qualifications I believe. And I'm also a naturally extremely gifted interviewee, and can deceive exceptionally well. If I failed, though, my intention, was to just keep putting out applications over and over until I fooled someone. It being a remote job, I essentially had an endless number of options to apply for.

If any one knows more regarding potential consequences or why you think I'm wrong, let me know and ill reply in the comments.

The author is encouraging their individual reader to take this approach.

However, when the author mentions ""79% of Americans in management positions admit to having lied, omitted, or exaggerated at least one part of their resume,"" they are making a collective call to action. They are suggesting that there is widespread dishonesty in job applications and interviewing processes, which implies that others should be aware of this issue and potentially take steps to address it.

The author's statement about not knowing the legal repercussions but expressing concern about potential employer no-contact lists also has a collective tone, as they are inviting readers to share their knowledge or experiences on this topic."," The post contains both an individual call to action and a collective call to action.

The individual call to action is evident when the user encourages others to lie on their resumes by stating ""If you think you can do the job and you want it, then I say try your best to fake it till you make it..."".

The collective call to action is implied in the statement ""In fact, 79% of Americans in management positions admit to having lied, omitted, or exaggerated at least one part of their resume."" This suggests that the user sees this practice as a widespread issue within the job market and encourages others to participate in it collectively to level the playing field.

The post starts with an invitation for the author to literally lie about anything on their resume, which is definitely an individual call to action. The tone of the post seems to be encouraging readers to take advantage of opportunities by being more flexible with the truth, especially in the context of job hunting.

However, as the post progresses, it shifts focus towards a collective call to action. The author emphasizes that many people are too honest and disqualify themselves because they don't use buzzwords or can't answer questions in the way interviewers want them to.

The language used by the author implies a sense of disillusionment and frustration with the capitalist system, which resonates with many individuals who feel similarly. The statement ""I'm touching 40"" could be seen as a personal reflection on the author's own experiences and feelings about work. This part of the post has an individual call to action, where the author is expressing their own emotional state.

However, the phrase ""the whole working hard thing is nothing more than a sham"" is more of a collective statement that critiques societal norms around work. It encourages readers to question and challenge these norms, which can be seen as a collective call to action. This part of the post invites discussion, critique, and perhaps even personal reflection or resistance from those who share similar sentiments.

Overall, while there are elements of both individual and collective expression, I believe the post leans more towards having a collective call to action, with the author inviting readers to consider their place within the system and potentially challenge its assumptions."," The post contains both an individual and a collective call to action.

Reasoning: The statement ""Americans were seriously sold some weird bullshit"" suggests the poster is encouraging individuals (American citizens in this case) to reconsider their beliefs about work, implying an individual call to action. The phrase ""the whole working hard thing is nothing more than a sham"" also implies the poster questions the traditional concept of hard work, which could be interpreted as a personal reflection or advice.

The individual call to action lies in the author's assertion that ""culture war issues are the only remaining venues where visible change can actually occur"". This could be seen as a personal invitation for individuals to take action within these culture war issues, although the post doesn't provide specific details or instructions on what actions to take.

On the other hand, the collective call to action is implicit in the author's statement that ""visible change can actually occur"" if we work together. However, the tone of the post suggests a sense of disillusionment and cynicism towards traditional avenues for economic change, implying that collective action may be futile or that it will only lead to exploitation.

99,Maximum Trickledown,,neither,"After reviewing the post, I would classify it as containing ""both an individual and a collective call to action.""

Here's why:

- The phrase ""Maximum Trickledown"" suggests that the author is advocating for a policy or strategy that benefits all stakeholders. This can be considered a collectivist idea, pushing for widespread changes.

- However, within this concept, there are also specific actions that individuals must take: maximizing one's personal gains through exploiting systems of inequality.
